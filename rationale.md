Rationale for an Observation Study

Gian Sammy and Ruot Thabac Duany

The idea of removing one's perspective from the interview was validated in this interview. Some of the answers were, indeed, surprising. One such answer was in regard to the accessibility of the bus stage (bus station) from the user's house.
The other concerned whether the station were clearly marked and are identifiable. The interviewee thought these two infrastructure issues in particular were just fine. This was contrary to what the interviewer had in mind. This is healthy and should be expected because not all neighborhoods are similar in Nairobi.
